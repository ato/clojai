ClojAI
======

This is the start of a Spring RTS AI written in Clojure.

Compiling
---------

Install JDK 5 (or later) and Apache Ant 1.4 (or later).

Then compile with:

  ant

Dependencies will be downloaded and compiled as necessary.

Interactive Development with SLIME
----------------------------------

ClojAI will attempt to start a swank server listening on port 4005.
So if you have a Clojure development environment with SLIME setup in
Emacs you can connect to it with:

  M-x slime-connect <return> 127.0.0.1 <return> 4005 <return>

The Spring AI interface callback object should be available as
clojai/*cb*.
